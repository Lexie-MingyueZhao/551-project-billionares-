# Billionaire Data Analysis Project

## Overview
The **Billionaire Data Analysis Project** aims to conduct an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the global distribution of billionaires. The analysis will focus on identifying geographic patterns and economic factors associated with wealth concentration.

## Project Goals
1. **Global Distribution Analysis**:
   - Visualize the worldwide geographical distribution of billionaires.
   - Identify wealth hotspots and clusters.

2. **Top 10 Cities Analysis**:
   - Select the top 10 cities with the highest number of billionaires.
   - Analyze the basic demographics and economic characteristics of these cities.

3. **Industry and Economic Correlation**:
   - Examine the key industries in each top city.
   - Compare billionaire industries with dominant city industries.
   - Evaluate the influence of city policies on billionaire wealth generation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather billionaire-related data (location, industry, net worth, etc.).
   - Collect economic and policy data for major cities.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   - Create visualizations for wealth distribution across countries and cities.
   - Use statistical summaries to describe key patterns.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Compare the industrial landscape of billionaire cities with their key economic sectors.
   - Assess correlations between billionaire industries and city policies.
