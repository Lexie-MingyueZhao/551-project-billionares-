## 2. List of Received Feedback & Changes Implemented

### Positive Feedback
- **Diverse Data Representations**: The mix of charts, maps, and tables was well received for its ability to present different aspects of the data.
- **Logical Structure**: Users appreciated the structured flow from broad overviews (world map, trends) to specific details (industry, top cities, education, etc.).
- **Interactivity**: The clickable map, filtering options, and other interactive features were engaging.
- **Clear Labels & Color Coding**: Most users found the visualizations easy to read, with effective color choices for data representation.

Although we have addressed most of the major feedback points, we plan to continue refining the dashboard in the following ways:

### 1. Enhance Accessibility
- Ensure all text is readable on different screen sizes.
- Conduct further tests for contrast adjustments.

### 2. Optimize Performance
- Review large datasets to improve loading times.
- Test on different devices to check responsiveness.

### 3. Fine-Tune Data Interactivity
- Expand tooltips to provide more granular insights.
- Consider adding additional filtering options for a better exploratory experience.
